# apeperia-project
In this project developed at Alura, we worked with the concept of 'mobile-first',
we incorporated a design of a layout from figma to HTML/CSS. From the mobile layout, 
we developed the responsiveness of the website for tablets and desktops.

<li> Analyze and organize the received layout;
<li> Use EMMET to create blocks of HTML code;
<li> Use the relative units REM and EM, image types and SVGs;
<li> What is mobile-first and what is it for;
<li> How does initial-scale work within the Viewport content;
<li> How to declare and call CSS variables;
<li> Use viewport units;
<li> Identify the difference between absolute and relative units;
<li> Analyze the physical limitations of devices;
<li> How to handle the layout images we receive;
<li> Tags and attributes that have more semantic function than style;
<li> The importance of writing semantic code;
<li> Create different styles for different devices with media queries;
<li> Adapt structure and content for different layouts;
<li> Progress from a mobile layout to a desktop layout.
